/* Even though there is not enough balls on stock. Clients are served with available balls for first cone
   ordered. For example if there is only 2 balls in stock but clients ordered 3 balls in first cone and 2
   in second cone, s/he shall be served with 2 available balls in first cone and for the second cone ordered,
   the program prints "Balls out of stock" . But there must be enough cone to make an order. Else, the program
   prints "Cone out of stock" each time a new cone is ordered."

   The program displays the welcome message at the top and Price list of ice creams and initial stock below.
   Count of final stock is also made and displayed. And at last the total profit made is displayed. */
